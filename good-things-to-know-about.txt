I was surprised by mention of RailsFactory in the question. also asking anonymously

Still willing to share our story

Will share my secrets
First secret getting started.

In 2006 when I had a opportunity to start on my own, I chose ruby on rails an upcoming web framework which was being used in startups.

a) We chose  ruby on rails
b) We wanted to work with startups and do exciting work
c) By calling ourselves RailsFactory, we kind of burned the bridges no php/python or other technology work would come for us 


So if you plan to hacker/programmer person and want to start a technology company, my advice would be
a) Focus on technology, 
b) Be a expert in your technology,
c) Always be accessible for your customers and developers, 
d) Price reasonably to keep you and your team busy,
e) Keep yourself updated on technology and industry changes,
f) Be part of local groups for entrepreneurs, technology,
g) Share your experience,
h) Be ethical,


There are no shortcuts, RailsFactory is the largest company I have worked in and also the longest time for that matter.

You have to survive before you can grow, self sustain the operations, have operating profit, pay taxes as it gives credibility and a chance to access to bank loans.

First 1-2 years we were very flat organization , but when the number grew and complexity grew, we have opted for hierarchical organization structure

Initial years, I and Dinesh played every role, but over time when you find responsible people inside the organisation or when you can hire them, you delegate those roles.

The last secret is persistence and sharing your success , I have been going to Open Coffee Club, Chennai Geeks and other events for past 6 years, and people know me as the guy from RailsFactory. Each time people ask me how I am and about my company, I have good things to tell, and they are excited and have more goodwill
