Sometimes life will look tough and we need that little something to keep us move on.  That little something is the inspirational quotes.  We love to read and get inspired from them, but after a few seconds we throw them out of our head.  The way we perceive life is often wrong.  Probably, the biggest thing we search in life is HAPPINESS.

People who search for happiness think that money and fame will make their life perfect.  

We strongly recommend you to read every single quotation and walk away with a brand new mindset.



You are a nice friend, will not forget.

Robin Sharma:  In your journal, write down five things you will do immediately to refuel your inner leader and take your mind, body, emotions, and spirit to their next level of excellence.  Then, schedule time to execute these five goals flawlessly during the next seven days so that you get the power of momentum working for you.

If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.

Chetan Bhagat
Everyone has dreams. Then life happens. And those dreams are crushed. People often stop doing what they did in college - sports, theatre, singing or dancing. 'I'm married and have a job and family now', they tell me.
Really? Because you have a family, you will murder your dreams? Because your job gives you a salary, you will never do the things you once loved?
A busy life may lower the flame of your dreams, but don't let the fire go out completely. A few hours a week, has to be your dream time.
Those who kill their dreams, also kill a bit of themselves.
Never make that compromise. Live life. Stay alive.
