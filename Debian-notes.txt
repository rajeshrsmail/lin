1) how to create a local repository out of your Debian system?

Step1:  Put your DVD to Drive.
Step2:  #apt-cdrom add

~~[ Note:  This will add a new entry in /etc/apt/sources.list ]~~

Check to see that it looks like the following:

cat /etc/apt/sources.list

deb cdrom:ubuntu 12.04 /pangolin main restricted

~~[ Note:  Actual packages are in /cdrom/pool/main & /cdrom/pool/restricted

Now, suppose you want to install NFS, then you should know its main package, that is, nfs-kernel-server.  It automatically installs dependent packages like nfs-common, portmap, along with 
the nfs-kernel-server package.

Step5: Now to install apache

# apt-get install apache2
